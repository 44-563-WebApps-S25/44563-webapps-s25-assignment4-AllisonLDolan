                ACT I
                PROLOGUE
                I come no more to make you laugh: things now,
                That bear a weighty and a serious brow,
                Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe,
                Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,
                We now present. Those that can pity, here
                May, if they think it well, let fall a tear;
                The subject will deserve it. Such as give
                Their money out of hope they may believe,
                May here find truth too. Those that come to see
                Only a show or two, and so agree
                The play may pass, if they be still and willing,
                I'll undertake may see away their shilling
                Richly in two short hours. Only they
                That come to hear a merry bawdy play,
                A noise of targets, or to see a fellow
                In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,
                Will be deceived; for, gentle hearers, know,
                To rank our chosen truth with such a show
                As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting
                Our own brains, and the opinion that we bring,
                To make that only true we now intend,
                Will leave us never an understanding friend.
                Therefore, for goodness' sake, and as you are known
                The first and happiest hearers of the town,
                Be sad, as we would make ye: think ye see
                The very persons of our noble story
                As they were living; think you see them great,
                And follow'd with the general throng and sweat
                Of thousand friends; then in a moment, see
                How soon this mightiness meets misery:
                And, if you can be merry then, I'll say
                A man may weep upon his wedding-day.

                    Then you lost
                    The view of earthly glory: men might say,
                    Till this time pomp was single, but now married
                    To one above itself. Each following day
                    Became the next day's master, till the last
                    Made former wonders its. To-day the French,
                    All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,
                    Shone down the English; and, to-morrow, they
                    Made Britain India: every man that stood
                    Show'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were
                    As cherubins, all guilt: the madams too,
                    Not used to toil, did almost sweat to bear
                    The pride upon them, that their very labour
                    Was to them as a painting: now this masque
                    Was cried incomparable; and the ensuing night
                    Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings,
                    Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
                    As presence did present them; him in eye,
                    Still him in praise: and, being present both
                    'Twas said they saw but one; and no discerner
                    Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns--
                    For so they phrase 'em--by their heralds challenged
                    The noble spirits to arms, they did perform
                    Beyond thought's compass; that former fabulous story,
                    Being now seen possible enough, got credit,
                    That Bevis was believed.
